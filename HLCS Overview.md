Sections

- Mission Statement: Ferg and Amad
- Costing: Amad and Ferg

Core Idea

Per section of Hyperloop track:
In github:
Define client side input, assign or calculate to global variable.
Have a readout of calculations.
Visual: Blender integration. If anyone finds a good blender tutorial let me know
Costing/routing with interface with the model after physical considerations dealt with (tube, pod, lev/prop. nodes)
Iterate client input to build section after section.

Initial Considerations

- Tube: dims, densities, volumes
- Pod: dims, densities, volumes
- Levitation and Propulsion: v, a, jerk, s, t, energy requirement/kilo moved 
- Routing: tunnelling, tbm m/sec, incline/declines, turning curves
- Nodes: stations, air lock, vacuum systems
- Mission Statement: who what why where when.
- Costing: Initially in joules. Case study into current proposals, equate to current modes of transport.
